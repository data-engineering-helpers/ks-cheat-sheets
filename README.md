# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/ks-cheat-sheets)
aims at collecting cheat sheets about software and data engineering subjects,
such as for instance JavaScript programming or DuckDB.
Each cheat sheet usually gives a quick starter and common use cases.

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.
