## PostgreSQL
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a good option to power the
  metadata of Airflow. And since PostgreSQL is also useful for other
  components such as LakeFS, this cheat sheet documents the setup of Airflow
  with PostgreSQL
* See [Data Engineering Helpers - Knowledge Sharing - PostgreSQL](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/ks-cheat-sheets/blob/main/db/postgresql/README.md)
  for more details on how to install some PostgreSQL server/service

## LakeFS
* [LakeFS](https://lakefs.io/) is a good addition to Airflow, as demonstrated
  for instance on
  [Airflow lakeFS examples 01](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS-samples/blob/main/01_standalone_examples/airflow-01)
  and
  [Airflow lakeFS examples 02](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS-samples/tree/main/01_standalone_examples/airflow-02)
